# AndroidThings-ObstacleAvoidanceSensor
Android Things Basics: Obstacle avoidance sensor with LEDÂ feedback

In this project we will use a LED as a notification when an obstacle is too close to our sensor.
We will learn how the standard I/O works with a GPIO in Android Things.

Requirements
We use a Raspberry Pi 3 with pre-installed Android Things Developer Preview(version 1).
I have a cheap Obstacle Avoidance Sensor and a Dual-color Common Cathode LED for this project.
(You can use any LED what you want)
